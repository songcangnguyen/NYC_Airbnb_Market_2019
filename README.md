# NYC_Airbnb_Market_2019

In this project, I will utilize my abilities in data importing, cleansing, and visualizing data to discover valuable information regarding the Airbnb industry in New York City in 2019 using **Python** and [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/song.cang.nguyen/viz/NYC_Airbnb_Dashboard/Dashboard1).

My task involves: 
* Importing data from various file formats and merging them together to address inquiries related to the Airbnb market in New York.
* Perform cleaning strings and manipulating dates to extract precise details from the datasets.
* Packages and tools utilized in this project are employed by data science on a daily basis, as a significant portion of the world's data is stored in non-standard formats and requires cleaning and preparation for analysis.

My goals is to answer business questions, which include: 
* What is average nightly price of Airbnb listing in New York City?
* How does average monthly price of an Airbnb listing compare to private rental market?
* What is count of advertisements for private rooms?
* How do prices of Airbnb listings compare among the five boroughs of New York City
